	<h1>Hi there, </h1>My name is Dorian Goldman and this is my blog where I'll write about Data Science, Machine Learning and other related topics.<br><br>
	
	I work as a research scientist at Lyft in New York, and as an adjunct professor of mathematics
	at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University </a>, where I teach the course <a href="https://github.com/Columbia-Intro-Data-Science/APMAE4990-">Introduction to Data Science in Industry </a>.
	<br><br> Previously I was a <a href="https://www.condenast.com"> Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer at Conde Nast</a>.
	
	Prior to this, I was a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, and before this, was a <a href="http://www.herchelsmith.cam.ac.uk/">Herchel Smith Research Fellow</a> in Mathematics at <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~dg443/">The University of Cambridge</a>, where I worked on problems
	related to energy driven pattern formation in mathematical physics. Click <a href="about/theisParis62.pdf">here</a> for a copy of my thesis (<a href="about/thesisNYU.pdf">NYU version</a>).
